# Image Classification on CIFAR-10 dataset using Keras and Tensorflow #
The CIFAR-10 dataset itself consists of 10 separate classes with 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

## Project Structure ##
1. **MiniVGGNet.py:** This is our TensorFlow + Keras implementation of MiniVGGNet
2. **train_network.py:** This is TensorFlow + Keras version of the training script. Script will also generate a training accuracy/loss plot as well
